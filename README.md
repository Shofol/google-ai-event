# NewsBreak (Smarter news, your way)

Imagine an AI assistant tailored for **journalists, writers, social activists, and engaged citizens** who navigate a flood of news daily. With so many events happening simultaneously, wouldn’t it be incredible to have **an assistant that can quickly summarize or explain the news? Think about the time and energy saved—enabling these individuals to focus on what truly matters: insights and action.**

Now, take it a step further. **These professionals often need to create impactful content—whether it's a blog article, a social post, an editorial, a campaign strategy, or even a poll to engage their audience or complete a work assignment. A social activist might spot breaking news worth rallying a campaign around.** Imagine having an AI assistant that not only understands the context but helps craft these outputs seamlessly. 

And, from this need I got the idea to build **NewsBreak**. An AI assistant like this wouldn’t just save time; it would empower users to amplify their voices, streamline their efforts, and bring their creative visions to life. 

## What it does
If you feed a news article as plain text to this AI assistant, it will offer you multiple ways to get help with. Right now, You will get eight tools to- 

1. Summarize the news into concise points (Summry can be of different type like- points, headline, tl;dr, etc.)
2. Write a blog article with SEO information required for that post
3. Get the explanation of the news with background context
4. Get suggestion social media post ideas
5. Draft editorials on that news topic
6. Design a campaign based on the news matter
7. Create a poll on the news
8. Receive feedback on your writing
